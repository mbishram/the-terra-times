      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>
        The term "Sarkaz" refers to a broad category of humanoid races distinct
        from both Ancients and Elders, being among the first intelligent beings
        to walk the surface of Terra. Once known as the Teekaz, the
        original natives of Terra, their era ended with the arrival of the
        Predecessors, who colonized the planet and inadvertently introduced
        Originium, along with the Ancients and the Elders. What followed were
        millennia of conflict between two biologically distinct races,
        eventually leading to the collapse of Teekaz civilization and the
        scattering of its people across Terra in a vast diaspora. This
        dissolution gave rise to four races that share common ancestry with the
        Sarkaz: the Sankta, Anasa, Oni, and Durins. The Sarkaz harbor deep
        resentment toward the Sankta in particular; they are considered traitors
        who betrayed the Teekaz and sullied a once-glorious legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sarkaz exhibit a wide range of physical traits depending on their
        tribe of origin. Horns are the most common Sarkaz identifier, varying in
        shape and size, alongside long, pointed ears and a variety of tails.
        However, there are some Sarkaz tribes lacking any of the aforementioned
        traits. While horns are a common features among Sarkaz, horn-removal is
        sometimes practiced in order to conceal their identities; this is often
        seen as a humiliating act of betrayal. Many Sarkaz have physical
        traits resembling Caprinae, resulting in infiltrations of Caprinae spies
        and refugees into their community. Nevertheless, the Sarkaz have
        numerous unique racial traits unseen in any other Terran race.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Oripathy Vulnerability: The Sarkaz were the first Terran race to
            come into contact with the oldest form of Originium, giving rise to
            their ancient racial curse—a heightened vulnerability to Oripathy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sarkaz Witchcraft: The inherent Sarkaz vulnerability to Oripathy is
            often seen as a double-edged blessing that allows them to enhance
            Originium Arts at the cost of their lifeforce.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Elongated Lifespans: The Sarkaz are known for having far longer
            lifespans than the average Terran, up to centuries or even
            millennia.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Collective Racial Memory: Unlike the empathic communication shared
            by the Sankta, the Sarkaz possess the capability to read the racial
            memories residing in their genes, particularly those of the
            deceased.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Esoteric Traditions: Due to the constant burden of Oripathy and
            social discrimination, the Sarkaz possess strong religious beliefs
            regarding death, firmly believing it to be the only release from
            their curse.

      <h1>Origin Myth</h1>

      <img src="public/images/Aish_Ha'rishón.png"
           alt="The first Teekaz molded themselves in the image of man after contacting the first Originium">

      <p>
        Being the earliest race dwelling upon Terra, the first Sarkaz/Teekaz
        were originally animal-like beings wandering around the world millennia
        ago. While they practiced a hunter-gatherer custom that is now perceived
        as grotesque to many non-Teekaz Terrans such as hunting upon others
        which is seen as "cannibalism" in modern eyes, their ancestors viewed it
        normally as mere survival instincts. But during a year of famine, a
        Teekaz decided to stop hunting his fellow men out of mercy but only to
        be banished to the dangerous "Silver Mountains" beneath the ground, but
        after 3,000 days when the underground Silver Mountains were brightened,
        that Teekaz turned into a human being after contacting the first
        Originium while wielding the "Black Crown," earning his respect from his
        tribesmen as the Farchaser, the first King of Sarkaz in their history.
      </p>
      <p>
        After spreading his new knowledge and molding his tribesmen into the
        image of man, the Farchaser led his tribe to conquer the Silver
        Mountains and pacify its rampaging souls, which in turn established
        their first civilization called "Kazdel," "Where home is." They begin to
        refer to themselves as "Teekaz," "one who owns a home" in their tongue.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the remaining centuries, the Teekaz civilizations prospered until
        the "Descending War" in 9,000 BCE between them and the alien Ancient and
        Elders. As many Teekaz civilizations fell to the aliens, the Farchaser
        desperately used the Amnannam, one of the First Originium, to summon the
        first Catastrophe in Terran history that brought upon the advent of
        Oripathy, which unfortunately cursed them with their vulnerability to
        Originium. The fleeing Teekaz refugees had become the rootless "Sarkaz",
        ushering in their centuries of exoduses and diaspora.
      </p>

    <article id="discrimination">
      <h1>Discrimination</h1>

      <p>
        Since the fall of their civilizations that forcefully displaced them as
        the sole inhabitants of Terra, the Sarkaz are banished to the lowest
        class of Terran society in which they are treated as "sub-humans" by the
        Ancient and Elders. Such conflict resulted in centuries of
        dehumanization and discrimination against the Sarkaz. As a consequence,
        many quickly call them "demons" or "devils" as racial slurs against
        them. They are falsely pictured as harbingers of Oripathy and calamities
        as well as bloodthirsty, cannibalistic warmongers who often ignite wars
        even though many of these are the consequences of the Sarkaz'
        homelessness. Social discrimination and oppression against them are
        prevalent across Terra from exemption from social welfare, apartheid
        policies, exploitations upon them by using them as mercenary pawns in
        battlefields, to even inhumane experimentation upon them.
      </p>
      <p>
        o many Sarkaz, such discrimination is seen as inevitable due to their
        sin as the first Infected, eventually surrendering themselves to
        reality. Nonetheless, they embrace their stereotypes as a rallying cry
        for unity. Their endless suffering has left them deeply embittered and
        vengeful despite attempts by some to convince the Sarkaz to move on from
        the past, leading to the Victorian Crisis instigated by the
        ultra-nationalist Military Commission of Kazdel.
